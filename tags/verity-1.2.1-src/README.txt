========================

	Verity is a small utility for generating truth tables of logical
statements of the sort that you would be assigned in a logic course.
Currently, it can output the tables as plain ASCII text, TeX markup, or LaTeX
markup.  See the manpage for more information.

	Verity was written by John T. Wodder II (minimiscience@users.
sourceforge.net) and is licensed under the GNU GPL, v.3 or later.  There's no
official code repository, but, if you have a Gopher client, you might be able
to find the latest version at <gopher://sdf.lonestar.org/99/users/jwodder/src/
verity-src.tgz>.
