=head1 NAME

B<verity> - generates truth tables of logical statements

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<verity> [B<-p> | B<-t> | B<-l>] [B<-s>] [B<-o> I<outfile>] [B<-e> I<statements> | I<infile>]

B<verity> [B<-h> | B<-V>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Verity> is a utility for generating the truth tables for sets of logical
statements.  Output can be as plain text, a TeX table, or a LaTeX I<tabular>
environment.  The statements can be read from the standard input or an
I<infile> or simply passed to B<Verity> on the command line as the argument to
an B<-e> flag.  The syntax for the statements is descriped below under
L</"STATEMENT SYNTAX">.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-e> I<statements>

B<Verity> treats I<statements>, along with the arguments of any following B<-e>
switches, as newline-terminated input.  If an infile is specified on the
command line, it is ignored.

=item B<-h>

Display a summary of command-line options and exit.

=item B<-l>

Output is in the form of LaTeX I<tabular> environments.  If the B<-s> option is
also specified, the tabulars are centered.

=item B<-o> I<outfile>

Output is written to file I<outfile>.

=item B<-p>

Output the table(s) as plain text.  This is the default.  The B<-p> option
overrides any previous B<-t> or B<-l> options.

=item B<-s>

(La)TeX output is ``standalone,'' i.e., a complete document rather than a
fragment suitable for importing into another document.  This option has no
effect on plain text tables.

=item B<-t>

Output is in the form of centered TeX tables.

=item B<-V>

Display version information & exit

=head1 STATEMENT SYNTAX

Statements consist of letters (other than C<v>, C<x>, and C<X>), representing
boolean variables, combined with logical AND (C<^>, C<&>, or C<&&>), logical
inclusive OR (C<v>, C<|>, or C<||>), and/or logical exclusive OR (C<x> or
C<X>).  Statements may be grouped within parentheses and negated with C<->,
C<!>, or C<~>.  They may also be combined with C<< -> >>, which results in a
statement which is false if & only if the left statement is true & the right
statement false, and C<< <-> >>, which creates a statement which is true if and
only if both the left & right statements have the same boolean value.
Parentheses and the negation operator have the highest & second highest
precedence, respectively, followed by the AND, OR, and XOR operators, then C<<
-> >>, and finally C<< <-> >>.  All binary operators are left-associative.

Statements are separated by semicolons or newlines, and all statements listed
in the input file are output in the resulting truth table.  There is no need to
list the variables explicitly, as any variables used will be automatically
placed at the left end of the table in the order in which they appear in the
statements.  The truth value of a specific statement can be assigned to a
variable by prefixing the statement with the variable, followed by a colon.

Multiple tables can be output by grouping the statements for each table between
braces.

Comments can also be inserted into the input, beginning with a pound sign
(C<#>) and continuing to the end of the line.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following line causes B<Verity> to output the combined truth table for the
statements ``p AND q'' and ``p OR q'':

    p ^ q; p v q

As plain text, the output for the above is:

    p|q|p^q|pvq
    -|-|---|---
    T|T| T | T
    T|F| F | T
    F|T| F | T
    F|F| F | F

For a somewhat more complex example, consider the following statements.  Note
that the statement C<p v -q> is assigned to the variable C<S> for ease of
reference in the statement after it.

    -p x q
    S : p v -q
    S -> q^r
    pvr <-> -(-p^-r)

When input to B<Verity>, the above statements yield the truth table:

    p|q|r|-pxq|S : pv-q|S->q^r|pvr<->-(-p^-r)
    -|-|-|----|--------|------|--------------
    T|T|T| T  |   T    |  T   |      T
    T|T|F| T  |   T    |  F   |      T
    T|F|T| F  |   T    |  F   |      T
    T|F|F| F  |   T    |  F   |      T
    F|T|T| F  |   F    |  T   |      T
    F|T|F| F  |   F    |  T   |      T
    F|F|T| T  |   T    |  F   |      T
    F|F|F| T  |   T    |  F   |      T

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

Assignment of statements to variables with the colon operator should be done
before the variable is used in any other statements.  Otherwise, the behavior
is undefined.

=head1 NOTES

The symbol used for XOR in (La)TeX output -- that of OR with a dot drawn above
it -- is not the most common symbol for the operation, and I am considering
changing it to something more well-known.
