VERITY TO-DO
- Replace all occurrences of my SourceForge e-mail address with my SDF address
- Update the copyright dates to include 2008
- Include a version history in the README
- Implement (Embedded?) PostScript output
- Improve the code?  (I seem to recall it needing improvements)
 - Improve veriprint.c
- Rewrite yyerror() to print out the input line number
- When this is all done, update the version number & release a new version
- Rewrite checkMem() to call yyerror()?
- Document the fact that comments don't constitute statement delimiters (or
  should they?)
- Make commas valid statement delimiters?
