VERITY TO-DO
Features:
 - Add an option to output UTF-8 operator symbols in plain text mode?
 - Implement (Embedded?) PostScript output
 - Make commas valid statement delimiters?
 - Implement error recovery up to the next EOL (though symbols that are only
   referenced in erroneous rules will need to be dealt with...)
 - Allow multi-block files to alternate between braces-enclosed statements and
   unenclosed statements (maybe)
 - Add a "<-" operator?

Documentation:
 - Note in the README that Bison is required for compiling

Other:
 - When this is all done, update the version number to 1.3 & release it
  - Make sure that the date for v.1.3 in the README's history is accurate
 - Sort variables in the tables in alphabetical order?
