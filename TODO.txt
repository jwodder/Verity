VERITY TO-DO
Things that need to be done or should be done:
 - Improve the quality of the PostScript output:
  - Make the dot in the (old) XOR symbol actually be centered
  - Lower the tops of the vertical bars & lower their bottoms
  - Lower the horizontal bars a bit?
  - Center the tables?
  - Adjust the spacing between symbols?
 - Handle PostScript tables that approach the bottom of the page (and ones that
   are too wide for the page?)
 - Reconsider the use of '+' as the new plain-text symbol for XOR
 - Properly document the nature of OLD_XOR_SYM somewhere prominently in the
   README
 - Amend the note on the XOR symbol in the manpage appropriately
 - Test out error recovery more (including checking for memory leaks)
 - If OLD_XOR_SYM is not defined, treat 'x' in input as a variable?
 - Deal with the overly long line output in the usage messages
 - Document the -u & -U options
  - Come up with a better way to describe them than as using "Unicode text"
 - Try to handle outputting of Unicode characters that don't exist in the
   current locale
 - Ignore (for syntactic purposes) invalid characters in input rather than
   exiting with an error?

Ideas for possible new features:
 - Make commas valid statement delimiters
 - Allow multi-block files to alternate between braces-enclosed statements and
   unenclosed statements (maybe)
 - Add a "<-" operator
 - Implement a way for users to define their own boolean functions/operators
  - All function names are single letters (or possibly one of a small set of
    punctuation marks), and if a binary function is used between two variables
    without parentheses around any arguments, it is interpreted as a binary
    operator (and this use should be honored in the output notation).
  - Possible example syntax: ``S(p, q) := p ^ -q''; ":=" and ':' should
    probably become alternate forms of each other (and be given the token name
    ``ASSIGN'' for error message purposes).
  - It should be possible to define functions outside of statement blocks,
    thereby making them available for all subsequent blocks.
 - Implement non-standalone PostScript output
 - Implement embedded PostScript output
 - Implement *roff/tbl(1) output
 - Support variable names of arbitrary length
 - Sort variables in the tables in alphabetical order
 - Allow wide (alphabetic) characters as variables?
 - Allow wide-character operators in input?
